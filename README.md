# Multi-layer-neural-networks
 Consists of using a multi-layer neural network to approCximate the bioprocess, where compound A and substrate are considered as inputs to the network and biomass as its output. To achieve this, the basic rules of data preprocessing, neural network design, training, and validation must be followed.
